/*
Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.

Notice
    Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

Example
    If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:
    [
      [3],
      [1],
      [2],
      [1,2,3],
      [1,3],
      [2,3],
      [1,2],
      []
    ]

Challenge
    Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
