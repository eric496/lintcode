/*
There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

Notice
    The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

Example
    Given 4 gas stations with gas[i]=[1,1,3,1], and the cost[i]=[2,2,1,1]. The starting gas station's index is 2.

Challenge
    O(n) time and O(1) extra space
